## What is gowitness?

At its core, gowitness is a specialized tool that automates the process of browsing, capturing, and cataloging websites. It employs Google's Chrome Headless browser to programmatically load web pages and take accurate screenshots while gathering enriched meta-information. Unlike generic screenshot tools, gowitness combines speed with advanced data collection, making it invaluable in fast-paced security assessments.

### The Problem It Solves

Manual screenshotting of targets is slow, inconsistent, and error-prone. While other tools capture images, they often lack the depth of data or UI integrations that allow teams to quickly assess reconnaissance results. gowitness fills this gap by delivering a pipeline that covers:

- Real-time web rendering for snapshot accuracy.
- Extraction of HTTP responses, TLS certificates, headers, cookies, network logs, console logs, and technology stacks.
- A clean, modern interface for iterative review without switching tools.

### What Sets gowitness Apart

- **Speed:** Built in Go with Chrome Headless, it captures screenshots and data faster than typical browser automation scripts.
- **Data Depth:** Collects rich associated data on every probe, enabling deeper analysis without extra steps.
- **Flexible Usage:** Supports single immediate probes and bulk job submissions with fine-grained options.
- **UI Integration:** Results appear in an interactive web UI tailored for rapid understanding and follow-up actions.
