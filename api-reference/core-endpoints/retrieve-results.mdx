# Retrieve Results & Gallery API Reference

Discover how to retrieve scan results through list, gallery, and detailed endpoints. This API section empowers you to programmatically access captured screenshots and their metadata to integrate visual and contextual data into your applications.

---

## Overview

The Retrieve Results & Gallery API provides three key endpoints designed to help you fetch scan results tailored to different use cases:

- **Results List**: A simple list view with core metadata suitable for summaries and bulk processing.
- **Gallery View**: A paginated, filterable gallery of results optimized for visual browsing with associated technologies and metadata.
- **Result Detail**: A full, detailed view of a single scan including the screenshot, metadata, and technical details.

These endpoints support filtering, pagination, and sorting options to help you efficiently query large datasets.

---

## Base URL

All endpoints are accessed relative to the API root (typically `/api` or `/results`), for example:

```
GET /results/list
GET /results/gallery
GET /results/detail/{id}
```

Authentication requirements should be checked in the general API auth documentation.

### 2. Gallery View Endpoint

For visually-driven applications, the gallery endpoint provides paginated and filterable results including technologies detected and screenshot references.

#### GET /results/gallery

**Description**: Returns a paginated gallery of scan results with filtering and sorting capabilities.

**Query Parameters:**

| Parameter       | Type    | Description                                                                 | Default |

**Response Structure:**

```json
{
  "results": [

      "id": 101,
      "probed_at": "2024-05-30T14:21:00Z",
      "url": "http://example.com",
      "response_code": 200,
      "title": "Example Domain",
      "file_name": "screenshot_101.jpeg",

**Path Parameter:**

| Parameter | Type | Description              |
|-----------|------|--------------------------|

## Usage Patterns & Tips

- Start with the **Gallery View** to browse results visually with context on detected technologies and filtering by HTTP status or failure.
- Use the **Results List** endpoint when you need a lightweight bulk export of scan metadata.
- Fetch individual scans in-depth with the **Detail Endpoint** to access rich metadata, including TLS certificate info and network logs.
- When requesting the Gallery endpoint, balance `limit` and `page` parameters to paginate through large data efficiently.
- Use filtering with technologies and status codes to narrow down large scans to relevant subsets.
- Sorting by perception hash groups via `perception=true` can organize visually similar scan results, aiding manual review.

---

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- Incorrect pagination parameters (e.g., zero or negative page/limit) revert to default pagination settings.
- Malformed filters (e.g., non-integer status codes) are ignored silently to avoid request failure.
- Large result sets without pagination can impact performance; always paginate large queries.
- The detail endpoint requires a valid existing ID; invalid IDs will result in empty or error responses.
- Failed result filtering defaults to including failures; explicitly set the `failed` parameter to control visibility.

---

## Example Combined Workflow

1. **Browse gallery page 1** with 24 results, filtering for `nginx` and HTTP 200:

```http
GET /results/gallery?page=1&limit=24&technologies=nginx&status=200 HTTP/1.1
```

2. **Select a result by ID (e.g., 101) to fetch details:**

```http
GET /results/detail/101 HTTP/1.1
```

3. **Retrieve a full list of results for bulk processing:**

```http
GET /results/list HTTP/1.1
```
