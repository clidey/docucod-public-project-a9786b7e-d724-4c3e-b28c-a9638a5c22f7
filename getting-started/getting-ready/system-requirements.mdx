# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Ensure your environment is properly prepared before installing or running gowitness. This guide details supported operating systems, essential dependencies, and important platform-specific notes to confirm compatibility and smooth operation.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

gowitness is designed to run on major desktop operating systems with compatibility for both 64-bit and selected ARM architectures:

- **Linux**
  - Architectures: amd64 (x86_64), arm64 (aarch64), and arm (32-bit)
- **macOS**
  - Architectures: amd64 and arm64 (Apple Silicon)
- **Windows**
  - Architectures: amd64 and arm64

Make sure you download or build the correct version matching your OS and architecture.

> <Check>
> Confirm your OS and architecture with the following command:
> ```bash
> uname -m && uname -s
> ```
> On Windows, use:
> ```powershell
> wmic os get osarchitecture
> ```

---

## 2. Essential Dependencies

### Go (Golang) Version

gowitness is written in Go and can be built from source. To build from source, you need:

- Golang **version 1.19** or higher

For typical users installing prebuilt binaries, Go is not required.

> <Tip>
> Use the command `go version` to check your installed Golang version.
> If missing or outdated, download the latest stable release from https://golang.org/dl/
> 
> Example output:
> ```
> go version go1.20 linux/amd64
> ```

### Google Chrome / Chromium Browser

gowitness relies on Chrome Headless as the rendering and screenshot engine. It can either:

- Automatically download the correct Chrome/Chromium binary for your platform
- Use an existing installed Chrome/Chromium binary on your system
- Connect to a remote existing Chrome instance via WebSocket

> <Note>
> If you want to use an existing Chrome binary, specify the path during configuration via the `--chrome-path` flag.
>
> For automatic downloads, no manual installation is required.

### Chrome Headless Compatibility

- gowitness uses the [go-rod](https://github.com/go-rod/rod) library
- Compatible with recent stable versions of:
  - Google Chrome
  - Chromium
  - Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based)

Ensure your browser version supports headless mode.

### Supported Browsers by Platform

| Platform    | Supported Browsers                     |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| Linux       | Google Chrome, Chromium              |
| macOS       | Google Chrome, Chromium, Safari not supported |
| Windows     | Google Chrome, Chromium, Edge        |

> <Warning>
> Safari and other non-Chromium browsers are **not supported**.

## 3. Platform-Specific Notes

### Linux

- Requires a working X11 or headless environment for Chrome Headless
- GLFW or other related dependencies are handled automatically by Chrome binaries
- If running without a display, ensure you have a virtual framebuffer (e.g., `Xvfb`) available or run in headless mode (default)

### macOS

- Supports both Intel and Apple Silicon (arm64); verify you download or build the correct binary
- Runs best with installed Google Chrome (Stable channel)

### Windows

- Support for Windows 10 and later
- Make sure you have the Edge or Chrome browser installed or rely on the auto-downloader

---

## 4. Network and Permissions Requirements

- **Network Connectivity:**
  - Ability to reach target URLs via HTTP or HTTPS
  - Required ports open for HTTP(S) traffic (default 80 and 443)

- **Filesystem Permissions:**
  - Write permissions to the configured screenshot directory (default `./screenshots`)
  - Write permissions to output directories or files if using output writers (e.g., database, JSONL, CSV)

- **Firewall & Proxy:**
  - If behind a proxy, specify it using the `--chrome-proxy` option (format: `http://address:port` or `socks5://address:port`)
  - Ensure firewall rules allow outbound connections required for scanning

---

## 5. Verifying Your Environment

Before proceeding with installation or scanning, validate your environment with the following checks:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Operating System and Architecture">
Run:
```bash
uname -s && uname -m
```
Verify it matches one of the supported platforms.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Go Installation (Optional, for building from source)">
Run:
```bash
go version
```
Ensure Go 1.19+ is installed if you plan to build gowitness yourself.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Browser Availability">
- If specifying a browser binary yourself, ensure the path is correct.
- Otherwise, verify internet access for auto-download.
</Step>
<Step title="Check File System Permissions">
Confirm you have write access to your intended output directories.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Tips

- **Incompatible Architecture:** Using a binary not matching your CPU architecture will cause execution failures.
- **Missing Dependencies When Building:** Ensure Go environment variables (`GOPATH`, `GOROOT`) are properly set.
- **Chrome Version Mismatch:** Very old or beta Chrome versions may cause unexpected errors.
- **Insufficient Permissions:** Running under restrictive accounts without write permissions will prevent saving screenshots/results.
- **Network Constraints:** Firewalls, proxies, and VPNs may affect scan reachability.

## 7. Next Steps

After confirming you meet these system requirements and prerequisites, proceed to [Installing gowitness](/getting-started/getting-ready/installing-gowitness) to set up the tool on your platform.

Once installed, you will configure scanning options and run your first scan, guided by [Running Your First Scan](/getting-started/your-first-scan/running-your-first-scan).
