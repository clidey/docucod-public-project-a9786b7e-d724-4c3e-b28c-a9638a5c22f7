# Installing gowitness

This guide walks you through precise, step-by-step instructions to install **gowitness** on all major platforms. Whether you prefer using Go tooling, downloading precompiled binaries, building from source, or running gwitness within Docker containers, this documentation covers your scenario. You'll also find best practices to help you choose the right installation method based on your needs.

---

## 1. Installation Methods Overview

**gowitness** can be installed in several ways:

- **Go-based installation**: Use `go install` to fetch the latest version directly into your Go environment.
- **Precompiled binaries**: Download platform-specific binary releases from GitHub.
- **Build from source**: Compile gowitness manually for full control and customization.
- **Docker image**: Run gowitness in a lightweight Docker container, requiring no host installation.

Each method has its own advantages depending on your platform, permissions, and update preferences.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before installing gowitness, ensure your environment meets these requirements:

- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows. Some Windows features may be limited but compatibility is mostly ensured.
- **Go version** (for installation from source or via `go install`): Go 1.18 or later is required.
- **Chrome or Chromium browser**: gowitness uses Chrome Headless for screenshots. If you don't specify a Chrome binary path, gowitness downloads a platform-appropriate headless Chrome automatically.
- **Network permissions**: Allow gowitness to access target URLs and download dependencies if needed.

Refer to the [System Requirements & Prerequisites](https://docs.sensepost.com/getting-started/getting-ready/system-requirements) for detailed platform-specific considerations.

## 3. Installing gowitness

### 3.1 Using `go install` (Recommended for Go Users)

This is the easiest way to get gowitness if you already have Go installed and your `$GOBIN` is in your path.

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run the command:

```bash
  go install github.com/sensepost/gowitness@latest
```

3. Confirm the binary is installed:

```bash
  gowitness version
```

Expected output displays the current gowitness version, confirming a successful installation.

<Check>
If the command is not found, verify that `$GOBIN` (often `$GOPATH/bin`) is in your system `PATH`.
</Check>

### 3.2 Downloading Precompiled Binaries

1. Visit the [gowitness Releases](https://github.com/sensepost/gowitness/releases) page on GitHub.
2. Find the latest stable release.
3. Download the appropriate binary for your OS and architecture (e.g., `gowitness-linux-amd64`, `gowitness-darwin-arm64.exe`, etc).
4. Make the binary executable (Linux/macOS):

```bash
chmod +x gowitness-linux-amd64
```

5. Move it to a directory in your system PATH, for example:

```bash
sudo mv gowitness-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/gowitness
```

6. Verify installation:

```bash
gowitness version
```

### 3.3 Build From Source

For power users or contributors who want custom builds:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sensepost/gowitness.git
cd gowitness
```

2. Ensure Go 1.18+ is installed.
3. Run the Makefile build command (builds binaries for multiple platforms):

```bash
make build
```

4. The compiled binaries will be located in the `build/` folder.

5. Copy the relevant binary to your PATH.

<Tip>
Check the Makefile for cross-compilation options and dependencies. Running `make clean` removes old build artifacts.
</Tip>

### 3.4 Using the Official Docker Container

If you prefer not to install anything directly, run gowitness inside Docker:

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running.
2. Pull the latest image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/sensepost/gowitness:latest
```

3. Run gowitness scanning commands inside the container:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/data ghcr.io/sensepost/gowitness scan single --url "https://sensepost.com" --write-db
```

Mount volumes to save screenshots and reports outside the container.

<Note>
Adjust volume mounts (`-v`) paths to match your local directory structure when using Docker.
</Note>

---

## 4. Post-installation Verification

After installation, verify that gowitness is ready to use:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run:

```bash
gowitness version
```

You should see output similar to:

```
gowitness

gowitness: vX.X.X
git hash: <hash>
build env: <env>
build time: <time>
```

3. Try running a basic scan command:

```bash
gowitness scan single --url "https://example.com" --write-db
```

4. Confirm no errors occur and screenshots save to `./screenshots` by default.

<Warning>
If you encounter errors such as missing Chrome or permission denied, refer to troubleshooting tips below.
</Warning>

## 5. Choosing the Best Installation Method

Select your installation approach based on:

| Use Case                           | Recommended Installation Method      |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Quick start on supported platform | `go install` or Precompiled Binary  |
| Custom builds or contributions    | Build from source                    |
| Containerized, isolated usage     | Docker container                    |
| No Go environment available       | Download binary or Docker           |

Remember that the `go install` approach requires Go 1.18+, while Docker works independently of your OS setup.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Installation Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="gowitness command not found after go install">
Verify that your Go binary path (`$GOBIN` or `$GOPATH/bin`) is added to your system `PATH`. You can add it temporarily with:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Consider adding it permanently in your shell profile.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission denied when executing gowitness binary">
Make sure the binary has execute permissions:

```bash
chmod +x /path/to/gowitness
```

If running on Windows, ensure your antivirus is not blocking execution.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Chrome/Chromium not found errors">
If gowitness cannot find Chrome, specify the path manually using the `--chrome-path` flag in your commands, or install Chrome/Chromium on your system.

Example:

```bash
gowitness scan single --url "https://example.com" --chrome-path "/usr/bin/google-chrome"
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Docker permission denied or volume mounting issues">
Ensure Docker daemon is running and you have permissions to mount volumes. Use absolute paths for volume mounts.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
