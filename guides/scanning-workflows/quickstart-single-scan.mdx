# Quickstart: Scan a Single Website with gowitness

Welcome to your first step using **gowitness** to capture a web screenshot of a single URL target. This guide will walk you through scanning a website, configuring output options, and saving your results in a database for easy later review. Whether you're a security professional, auditor, or just exploring gowitness, this hands-on guide sets you up for immediate success.

---

## 1. What You Will Achieve

- Take a screenshot of a single web URL using gowitness
- Configure options such as screenshot format, window size, and timeout
- Save scan metadata and screenshots into a SQLite database
- Understand how to verify successful completion

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- gowitness installed on your system. If not, install it via:

  ```bash
  go install github.com/sensepost/gowitness@latest
  ```

- Google Chrome or Chromium installed (required for headless browsing)
- Basic familiarity with command line operations

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare your command

Your goal is to run the `gowitness scan single` command targeting the website URL.

### Step 2: Run a basic scan

Execute the following command to scan a single URL and save screenshots locally:

```bash
gowitness scan single -u https://sensepost.com
```

- The `-u` flag specifies the URL to screenshot
- By default, only screenshots are saved in the `./screenshots` directory

Expected outcome: gowitness loads the page, captures a screenshot, and saves it locally.

### Step 3: Save results to a database

To retain metadata along with the screenshot, use the `--write-db` flag:

```bash
gowitness scan single -u https://sensepost.com --write-db
```

- This stores results in a SQLite database (`gowitness.sqlite3` by default)
- Screenshots still save automatically to the `./screenshots` folder

### Step 4: Customize scan options

You can adjust the scanning environment:

- Set browser window size:

  ```bash
gowitness scan single -u https://sensepost.com --write-db --chrome-window-x 1920 --chrome-window-y 1080
```

- Change screenshot format (jpeg or png):

  ```bash
gowitness scan single -u https://sensepost.com --write-db --screenshot-format png
```

- Increase timeout if the page loads slowly:

  ```bash
gowitness scan single -u https://sensepost.com --write-db --timeout 90
```

### Step 5: Confirm scan completion

Upon success, gowitness will show logs indicating the scan completion.

Check the following:

- Screenshot saved under `./screenshots` with the target URL hostname as filename
- `gowitness.sqlite3` database file created or updated with scan details

You can later view or query the database for full scan metadata.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Example 1: Simple scan with screenshot only

```bash
gowitness scan single -u https://sensepost.com
```

Expected result: Screenshot saved as JPEG in the default folder.

### Example 2: Scan with database output and timeout adjustment

```bash
gowitness scan single -u https://sensepost.com --write-db --timeout 120
```

Expected result: Metadata saved to SQLite DB; screenshot saved as JPEG.

### Example 3: Scan with PNG screenshots at custom window size

```bash
gowitness scan single -u https://sensepost.com --write-db --screenshot-format png --chrome-window-x 1366 --chrome-window-y 768
```

Expected result: PNG screenshots taken at specified resolution, metadata saved.

## 5. Tips and Best Practices

- **Use descriptive filenames or organize your output folder** to avoid overwriting screenshots.
- **Increase timeout for slow or heavy websites** to prevent premature scan failures.
- **Combine output flags for richer data**: use `--write-jsonl`, `--write-csv`, or `--write-stdout` for different use cases.
- **Set user-agent strings** if target sites behave differently:

  ```bash
  --chrome-user-agent 'Mozilla/5.0 (Custom)'  
  ```

- **Run scans inside reliable network environments** to avoid connectivity timeouts or DNS issues.

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Single URL Scans">
<Accordion title="1. Error: 'a URL must be specified'">
Ensure the `-u` or `--url` flag is provided with a valid URL. Example:

```bash
gowitness scan single -u https://example.com
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. No screenshots saved or empty output">
- Verify that Chrome or Chromium is installed and accessible in your system PATH.
- Check permissions on the `./screenshots` directory.
- Use debug logging with `-D` to inspect errors:

```bash
gowitness -D scan single -u https://sensepost.com
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. Timeout or page load failures">
- Increase the `--timeout` value.
- Check network restrictions or firewalls blocking access to the target URL.
- Use `--delay` to give pages extra time before screenshotting.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="4. Database write errors or missing DB file">
- Confirm `--write-db` is correctly specified.
- Check your permissions for the folder where `gowitness.sqlite3` is created.
- Use `--write-db-uri` to specify a different database location if needed.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
